# Portfolio Project Summary

## Project Title
**Pharmaceutical Distribution & Route Optimization Platform**

## One-Line Description
A full-stack web application for optimizing pharmaceutical delivery routes using 6 different pathfinding algorithms with real-time visualization and performance analytics.

## Technologies Stack
**Frontend:** React 18, Material-UI, Leaflet.js, Recharts, Axios
**Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, NetworkX, Pandas
**Database:** SQLite/PostgreSQL
**DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose
**Testing:** Pytest, Jest

## Key Features Implemented
1. ✅ 6 pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Dijkstra, Bidirectional)
2. ✅ Interactive maps with custom SVG icons for delivery trucks and warehouses
3. ✅ Real-time performance comparison with charts
4. ✅ RESTful API with Swagger documentation
5. ✅ Database integration for route history
6. ✅ Pharmaceutical industry-themed UI
7. ✅ Docker containerization
8. ✅ Responsive design

## Problem Solved
Pharmaceutical distribution companies need to optimize delivery routes across multiple cities to ensure timely medication delivery. This platform helps logistics managers compare different routing algorithms to find the most efficient path, considering distance, time, and computational efficiency.

## Technical Highlights
- **Algorithm Complexity Analysis**: Implemented 6 different graph traversal algorithms with Big O notation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with services, models, and API layers
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics (execution time, nodes explored, distance)
- **Professional UI/UX**: Industry-specific design with gradient cards, custom icons, and interactive dashboards
- **Full-Stack Integration**: FastAPI backend seamlessly integrated with React frontend

## Challenges Overcome
1. **Leaflet Icon Loading**: Resolved webpack import issues with custom SVG delivery truck and warehouse icons
2. **Algorithm Comparison**: Implemented fair comparison by tracking performance metrics consistently across all algorithms
3. **Real Geographic Data**: Integrated actual latitude/longitude coordinates for 61 Pakistani cities
4. **Responsive Design**: Created a professional pharmaceutical company theme that works on all screen sizes

## Code Quality
- ✅ Unit tests with Pytest (15 tests passing)
- ✅ Type hints throughout Python code
- ✅ RESTful API design principles
- ✅ Clean component architecture in React
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
